# MLOps Engineer Challenge
Docker compose version

This repo shows how the model container can be used via a simple streamlit app. There is no focus on CI/CD because of time constraints.

## Usage
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:8501/` and run inference on the test images with the model of your choice. An examplary result will be visualized in the frontend.
